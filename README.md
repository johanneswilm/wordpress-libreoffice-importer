## Document Format Guidelines

For best results, structure your LibreOffice documents as follows:

### Title
The **first line** of your document will be used as the post title. Make it short and descriptive.

### Author Information
Include author information in one of these formats:
- `Author: John Doe`
- `By John Doe`
- `Written by: John Doe`

The plugin will attempt to match the author name with existing WordPress users.

### Abstract/Summary
The first 2-3 paragraphs after the title and author information will be considered as the post excerpt/abstract (configurable in settings).

Alternatively, you can explicitly mark an abstract:
```
Abstract: This is the summary of my post...
```

### Main Content
Write your main content using standard LibreOffice formatting:
- **Headings** (Heading 1-6) will be converted to HTML h1-h6
- **Bold**, *italic*, and <u>underline</u> formatting will be preserved
- Bulleted and numbered lists
- Tables
- Images (embedded inline)
- Hyperlinks
- Footnotes

## Configuration

Navigate to **LO Importer > Settings** to configure:

### Content Extraction
- **Extract Author Information**: Automatically detect and match authors
- **Extract Abstract/Summary**: Use first paragraphs as excerpt
- **Abstract Maximum Paragraphs**: Number of paragraphs to include (default: 3)

### Import Options
- **Import Images**: Upload images to media library
- **Import Footnotes**: Convert footnotes to WordPress format
- **Preserve Formatting**: Keep all text styling

### Post Settings
